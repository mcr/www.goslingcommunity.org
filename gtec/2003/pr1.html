OTTAWA CONGRESS CENTRE -- If you're a public sector IT professional, and
you're not sure what Canada GOOSE and GOSLING really stand for, then a new
centrepiece feature of the GTEC WEEK information technology exhibition
ought to be your first stop on your tour of exhibits at the Ottawa Congress
Centre, October 7-8.

<P>

Canada GOOSE stands for Canada Government Official Open Source Engagement
and GOSLING is the acronym for Getting Open Source Logic Into Governments.

<P>

These are just two initiatives in a major, relatively new worldwide
software technology movement known as Open Source. That's the name given by
the software user and developer community to have international
standards-based source code for software be freely open and available to
software designers, developers and programmers to build upon. The
exhibition hall at GTEC Week celebrates the Open Source movement with an
unique public/private-sector partnership learning and demonstration lab as
the centrepiece of the show at the Ottawa Congress Centre, October 7-8.

<P>

In just one example of what will be demonstrated in the Lab, PWGSC will
show its &quot;proof of concept&quot; IBM ThinkPad running only free/libre
software (RedHat 9, Novell Netware Client for Linux, OpenOffice, ArgoUML,
etc.). This particular laptop has served for the past six months as the
primary computer for a busy manager in his day-to-day work within the
department's conventional proprietary corporate environment.

<P>

Besides knocking about $500 off the cost of the laptop, his system remained
up and running during the recent round of worm and virus attacks that put
his colleagues in neighbouring cubicles out of action.

<P>

Open Source is a business community and technology movement that co-exists
with the proprietary software model that has dominated the IT landscape for
two decades. Many if not most companies in the information technology
sector now have some active involvement with Open Source communities,
according to GTEC Week organizers. The lab focuses on Open Source solutions
and services available to government, as well as those developed and
offered by government.

<P>

Open Source is a software user and programming community-led movement to
provide a powerful alternative to proprietary software model that has
dominated the IT landscape for several decades. Many if not most companies
in the information technology sector now have some active strategy relative
to Open Source computing, according to GTEC Week organizers. The lab
focuses on Open Source solutions and services available to government, as
well as those developed and offered by government.

<P>

Another feature of the Lab will be a recently-completed report, prepared
under contract by e-cology Inc. and entitled &quot;Open Source Business
Opportunities for Canada's Information and Communications Technology Sector
- A Collaborative Fact Finding Study.&quot; The study was sponsored by
Industry Canada, PWGSC, and the CIO Branch at TBS.

<P>

Like the Open Source professional communities it highlights, the GTEC Open
Source Lab is designed to include organizations of all types, including
large, global enterprise, small and medium-size enterprises, non-profit
communities, government and academic teams, and individual volunteers.

<P>

Open Source Lab is open to any organization offering services or solutions
based on www.opensource.org or www.gnu.org certified &quot;open
source&quot; or &quot;free software&quot; licenses.

<P>

In association with the GTEC Open Source Lab, senior security specialists
from RedHat, Cinnabar, FreeS/WAN, and the IT Security Techniques Sub
Committee of JTC 1 (the ISO &amp; IEC international standards consortium),
will participate on an &quot;Experts Panel: Understanding Open Source
Security Strategy&quot;. This special session of the Open Seminar Program
will be from 2:00-3:00 P.M, Tuesday, October 7, in the Quebec Room, 4th
Floor of the Westin Hotel.

<P>

Global companies participating in the Lab area, such as RedHat, Novell, SUN
Microsystems and AML, are showing visitors how the open source business
model can be commercial and highly competitive with solutions ranging from
open source corporate desktop suites, to embedded Linux-based handheld
devices.

<P>

GTEC exhibitors such as IBM, Apple and Oracle, will also be highlighting
their open source commitments within their main displays on the show floor.

<P>

PUBLIC, PRIVATE PARTICIPANTS IN THE OPEN SOURCE LAB

<P>

standardization.

<P>

The Government of Nunavut is also a featured public sector participant in
GTEC's Open Source Lab, along with Macadamian Corporation of Ottawa. They
