1. OVERVIEW

<P>

GTEC WEEK is Canada's largest annual gathering of public sector technology
professionals.  The 2003 event features an "Open Source Lab" on the
exhibition floor, focused on open source solutions and services available
to government, or produced and offered by government.

<P>

Participation in the Open Source Lab is open to any organization offering
services or solutions based on www.opensource.org or www.gnu.org certified
"open source" or "free software" licenses. The primary focus of the Lab
will be to create an interactive environment where GTEC visitors can "test
drive" software and hardware based on free/libre open source technologies,
speak to experts about both business and technical issues, and discuss the
opportunities that come with including the open source business model in
public and private sector operations. The scope can include training,
market research, or legal services for open source projects.  Additional
suggestions are welcome.

<P>

For each hands-on demo, an effort is being made to pair open source
supplier representatives with current or prospective government business
users, so that visitors can discuss both technical and business interests.
Please contact Joseph Potvin joseph.potvin_AT_pwgsc.gc.ca regarding
Government of Canada participation.

<P>

The Open Source Lab has excellent exposure, located in a 30 ft X 30 ft
section, right at the centre of the exhibition floor in the Ottawa Congress
Centre (3rd level). The GTEC audience profile is summarized at the

2. THEMES

<P>

The overall theme of the 2003 GTEC Open Source Lab is "Diversity". Though
we take a "big tent" approach, space is limited.  Therefore participants
are encouraged to focus upon how the open source business model enables:

<UL>
<LI>different organizational forms for software production;
<LI>linguistic diversity;
<LI>accessibility for people of varying physical capabilities;
<LI>platform independence;
<LI>co-existence with incumbent solutions;
<LI>inter-operability through open, vendor-neutral standards;
<LI>competitive business practices.
</UL>
Related "sub-themes" can be proposed.

<P>
3. A RANGE OF PARTICIPATION OPTIONS

<P>

Like the open source professional communities it highlights, the 2003 GTEC
Open Source Lab is designed to include organizations of all types,
including global corporations, small and medium enterprise, non-profit
communities, and individual volunteers.  The Lab will "break even"
financially, so that proceeds from fees will be put towards covering shared
costs of the Open Source Lab, including expenses for participating
non-revenue-based communities, and direct support from GTEC itself.

<P>
(a) Booth Space: $2980

<P>

Eight booths are available for rent by one or two organizations each.  
Space sharing agreements for joint rental of a single booth must be
arranged by the tenants. Each equipped exhibition booth costs $2980 plus 7%
GST.  For more information, please contact Leslie Johnston lesliej AT
coltermangroup.com 613-731-9851 ext 13. Additional information is at the
following URL:

HREF="http://www.gtecweek.com/english/exhibitor_information/esm/index.php?s=esm">http://www.gtecweek.com/english/exhibitor_information/esm/index.php?s=esm</A>

A
100-word description of the booth exhibit for publicatin in the GTEC
exhibition guide should be provided by end-of-day Friday 26 September to
Debbie Beimers debbie _AT_ coltermangroup.com 613-731-9851 ext 12.

<P>
(b) Brochure Pockets for Rent: $100

<P>
Any organization or individual offering services related to
www.opensource.org or www.gnu.org certified "open source software" or "free
software" licenses can rent one or more brochure pockets for 8.5 X 11 inch
brochures or leaflets, in several stands that will be prominently displayed
in the Lab area. Each brochure pocket for the two days of the exhibition
costs $100 plus 7% GST.  Personnel staffing the Open Source Lab will direct
visitors to the brochures, identifying individual solutions for them, and
re-filling the pockets as required.  Each brochure "tenant" is responsible
to provide Lab staff with an adequate supply of brochures. (Brochures may
contain policy commentary combined with info on solutions and services, but
"political pamphleteering", per se, is not appropriate at this venue.)
Brochures may include any media. NOTE: To guarantee delivery of your
brochures directly to the Open Source Lab, GTEC has an agreement with "GES
Logistics". Details will be provided with your registration. Packages
should arrive by Sunday 6 October, addressed to: "GTEC Week - Booth 1610
'Open Source Lab', Ottawa Congress Centre, Third Level (Congress Hall),
Ottawa, Canada".

<P>
(c) Face-to-Face Personnel: $100

<P>
Any organization or individual that has rented a brochure pocket can 
also 
place a marketing person within the Lab area to promote their solutions to visitors.  A maximum of 15 individuals can be accommodated in this manner, and these places are available on a first-come/first-served basis. Placing a person within the Lab for the two days of the exhibition costs an additional $100 plus 7% GST.  This arrangement does not include a booth, however stools will be available to relieve tired legs.
