This site makes use of Server Side Includes (Both based on <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_include.html">Apache's
mod_include</A> as well as <A
HREF="http://www.php.net/manual/function.include.php">PHP3's include</A>)
to put common headers/footers on every page.  This header/footer is
maintained in a central place, and changes to it show on all pages on the
site.

<P>
The two methods are demonstrated as follows:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="demo.shtml">SSI Sample</A>
(<A HREF="source.php3?demo.shtml">Source</A>)<BR>
This is the version that should be used on most pages, and is the most
portable and fastest for the server to process.

<P>
<LI><A HREF="demo.phtml">PHP Sample</A>
(<A HREF="source.php3?demo.phtml">Source</A>)<BR>
This one is used by the Software developers for interactive pages.


</UL>

<P>

Accessability is something that is important for general web work, and as
promoters of freedom of choice in other areas likely even more important
for Green Party work. As a primer to doing pages, please read the <A
HREF="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/abdesign.shtml">Accessible Design
Guide</A>.  Once you page is done, please see if there are any critical
problems with it by checking it with both the <A
HREF="http://validator.w3.org/">W3.org validator</A> as well as <A
HREF="http://www.cast.org/bobby/">Bobby</A>.
