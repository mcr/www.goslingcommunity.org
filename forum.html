<H2>Ottawa Chapter</H2>

<P>
The Ottawa chapter of GOSLING has both an online and face-to-face gathering place.

<P>Face-toFace: Please go to the <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Promoting-Open-Source-Libre-to-the-Canadian-government/" target="_GOSLINGMEET">Meetup page</A> for details about the time/location.

<P>Online: This <A 
HREF="http://list.goslingcommunity.org/mailman/listinfo/ottawa-gosling">ottawa-gosling</A>
 discussion list does not publish an archive, but we request new members introduce themselves.  This is not a list for lurking. The list is an extension of the  face-to-face meetings at the gaggles, and thus sometimes has messages that 
are aimed to the community but not specifically "on topic" towards the GOSLING goal.
